# Superstore - Profits and Losses

## Intro
In this project I was given the opportunity to analyze data from a Superstore to determine how to increse the profitability and decrease the amount of losses they may experience. Also, the superstore wants to know the best ares to focus their advertisements in according to the total profits. I needed to identify the 3 best combinations of states and month of the year to advertise in.

## Data 
In this sheet I provided the total profits for each Sub-Category and divided each region to find the top sub-categories per region.

This sheet illustrates the top profits by the month and state. I chose the illustrate this through a treemap.

This dashboard highlights average profits by the sub-category and by shipping preference. I created scatterplots to illustrate the highest profits in each.

## Result 
Based on the month and state with the best average profits, I determined these were the best areas to focus on advertisement. I also showed the superstore what their advertisement spend amount would be for each location, being that they were only willing to spend 1/5 of the profits in each area.
