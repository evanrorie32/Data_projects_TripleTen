# Superstore - Return Rates 

## Description
In this project I was tasked with analyzing data from a Superstore to determine the factors that caused a high number of return orders.

Here is the final Dashboard

## Dashboard
1. I LEFT JOINED the Returns Table to the Orders Table
2. I then created a calculated field for the Returns Table to change the values "Yes" and "null", and replaced them with a 1 and 0. 

In this sheet I created a map to show the average return rate by each state and color coded it to show the difference.

In this sheet I created a bar chart highlighting each month and it's average return rate.

In this sheet I created a bar chart with the average return rate by the category of the product.
