# Superstore - Return Rates 

## Description
In this project I was tasked with analyzing data from a Superstore to determine the factors that caused a high number of return orders.

--------
Here is the final Dashboard

## Dashboard
1. I LEFT JOINED the Returns Table to the Orders Table
2. I then created a calculated field for the Returns Table to change the values "Yes" and "null", and replaced them with a 1 and 0. 

In this sheet I created a map to show the average return rate by each state and color coded it to show the difference.

---------

In this sheet I created a bar chart highlighting each month and it's average return rate.

----------

In this sheet I created a bar chart with the average return rate by the category of the product.

-----------

In this sheet I created a scatterplot comparing the sum of returns with the total sales for each sub-category, in order to see what product is the most profitable.

------------
In these next 2 sheets I created a bar chart comparing the average returns for each state to the category and subcategory.

## Results 

There were several factors that contributed to the return rates being high.
* There were a higher amount of returns during fall and entering the winter months
* Western states have a higher return rate than other regions
* Technology had a slightly higher return rate than the other 2 categories
