# Superstore - Return Rates 

## Description
In this project I was tasked with analyzing data from a Superstore to determine the factors that caused a high number of return orders.

## Dashboard
1. I LEFT JOINED the Returns Table to the Orders Table
2. I then created a calculated field for the Returns Table to change the values "Yes" and "null", and replaced them with a 1 and 0.
