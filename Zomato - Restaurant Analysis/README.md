## Dashboard 
This sheet I created a bar chart with each restuarant and their total sales. I put the results in descending order, showing the restaurants with the highest sales quantity at the top. I also added color gradients to show the highest sales easier. Finally, I created a filter to show the results of the top 20 restaurants.

This sheet I created a scatterplot to comparae the average sales to average ratings. I created a filter to group restaurants with the same ratings count and color coded them accordingly. The filter is available on the right to show the results of certain rating counts.

This sheet i created a bar with the top 3 cuisine preferences for each city. I created a calculated field and applied it to the chart and also color coded the cuisines to make it easier to view.
