## Airbnb Listings

# Introduction
In this project I was given data on airbnb listings and I was supposed to analyze the Manhattan vacation rental market. I was supposed to answer the questions of:
1. Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e. number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?
2. How much money did these listings generate?

## Top Neighborhoods by Reviews
This Pivot Table looks at the different neighborhoods and compares them to airbnb's with different bedroom amounts in order to determine what area has the most reviews.
