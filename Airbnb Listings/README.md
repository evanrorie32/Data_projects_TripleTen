## Airbnb Listings

# Introduction
In this project I was given data on airbnb listings and I was supposed to analyze the Manhattan vacation rental market. I was supposed to answer the questions of:
1. Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e. number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?
2. How much money did these listings generate?
